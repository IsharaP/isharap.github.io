excerpt: >
  Designed a vision-based workflow for automatic detection and tracking of blastomeres and micropipettes during Preimplantation Genetic Diagnosis (PGD) of IVF procedures, enabling continuous visual guidance during embryo biopsy.
highlights:
  - "Built a workflow to auto-detect/track blastomeres and micropipettes using cell segmentation and robust feature-based visual tracking"
  - "Demonstrated reliable multi-frame tracking under variable lighting and partial occlusions"
  - "Enabled steadier cell handling and fewer re-acquisitions during embryo biopsy"
