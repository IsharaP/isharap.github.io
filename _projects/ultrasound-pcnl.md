excerpt: >
  Developed a robot-assisted ultrasound guidance workflow for PCNL surgery that tracks kidney stones in real time during patient breathing, achieving near real-time tracking with ≈1 frame error and probe-skin force within 0.2 N.
highlights:
  - "Built a surgical assistance procedure via pre-operative anatomical modelling, intra-operative image registration, and image-guided needle insertion"
  - "Designed a two-step ultrasound out-of-plane tracking workflow achieving visual tracking error of ≈1 frame"
  - "Established compliant human-robot operation by variable-admittance and adaptive control for ultrasound probe handling"
  - "Maintained safe probe-tissue contact via position-based control, keeping force deviation below 0.2 N"
  - "Patent licensed to Creative Medtech Solutions Pte Ltd for commercialisation"
