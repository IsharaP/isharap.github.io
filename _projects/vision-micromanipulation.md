excerpt: >
  Developed a calibration-less, self-initialising robotic micromanipulation system with sub-pixel tool-tip localisation, confidence-weighted hybrid tracking, and autonomous refocusing — enabling portable, plug-and-play cell handling on low-cost microscopes.
highlights:
  - "Delivered sub-pixel tool-tip localisation with a low-cost and portable microscope setup"
  - "Designed tool-tip auto-focus algorithm, moving tip 95.3% closer to the focal plane"
  - "Built self-initialisation and recovery algorithm improving localisation from >50% error to <10% of specimen size"
  - "Implemented confidence-weighted hybrid tracking with visual and motion data fusion, reducing error by 18%"
  - "Achieved 97.7% cell detection accuracy and <1-pixel average visual-servo error"
