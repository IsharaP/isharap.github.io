excerpt: >
  Developing clinically deployable AI-driven PET/MR imaging biomarkers to support early detection, treatment monitoring, and evidence-based clinical decision-making in Alzheimer's disease.
highlights:
  - "Designed shorter amyloid-PET acquisition protocols, cutting scan time up to 50% and uptake time by 20–40% at repeat-scan accuracy"
  - "Led a tracer comparison study with AI-enabled quantification, achieving a lower positivity threshold of 15 CL vs 46 CL"
  - "Deployed containerised 3D U-Net segmentation on HPC/GPU for reproducible cohort-scale processing"
  - "Operationalised end-to-end imaging pipelines across ADNI/AIBL/OASIS-3 datasets, securing $100k+ external funding"
