excerpt: >
  PhD research developing objective fNIRS-based functional connectivity measures to investigate how the brain's language networks develop in early childhood, enabling early identification of language-related difficulties in infants with hearing impairment.
highlights:
  - "Revealed that language networks exhibit topological differences between resting and steady states in normal-hearing infants"
  - "Demonstrated that connections between spatially distant primary language regions strengthen with age during infancy"
  - "Developed short-channel correction methods to reduce false discoveries in resting-state functional connectivity"
  - "Investigated the effect of data length on frequency-domain fNIRS functional connectivity measures"
