  Final-year undergraduate project developing a brain-computer interface by decoding steady-state visually evoked potentials (SSVEP) to assist individuals with locked-in syndromes to communicate basic daily needs.
highlights:
  - "Developed a BCI system decoding visually-evoked potentials for communication assistance"
  - "Designed a system to help people with locked-in syndromes express basic daily needs to caretakers"
  - "Conducted an in-depth study of SSVEP signals against stimulus frequency and distance"
